The plots in this folder follow from the setup and initial conditions for the 4 cases of the double-quadratic example detailed the paper which are used to test the performance with sub-horizon e-folds and convergence.

The data and plots were generated using the timing.py script adjusting the horizon crossing time and alpha beta configuration.

The associated raw data is in the data subfolder of this folder.
